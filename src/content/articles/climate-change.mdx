###### Disclaimer
This isn't an article meant to sway people into thinking a certain way, though I hope that whatever you take from this is inspiring to you. I'm of the mindset that right or wrong, the data is left to minds other than my own and the reliance on global participation to mitigate any potential is out of my control as well. I'm not here to argue that a potential exists, that an agenda exists/doesn't exist, or that certain sources should be trusted over others.

That's ultimately up to you to decide. This article is meant solely for the purpose of reflection regarding my personal decisions on the matter.

As far as I'm concerned, compelling data exists on both sides of the argument. I'm just not one for gambling and I'll always instinctually err on the side of caution.
